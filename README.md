# -End-to-End-ML-Pipeline-with-Scikit-learn-Pipeline-API-
An end-to-end ML pipeline using Scikit-learn's Pipeline API automates data preprocessing, feature transformation, and model training. It ensures cleaner code, reduces data leakage, and allows easy experimentation, evaluation, and deployment by encapsulating the workflow into a single reusable object.
